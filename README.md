# SDL2 Development Libraries for CI
SDL2 Visual-C++ Development Libraries from the official website. Currenty at version 2.0.10 downloaded from https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.10-VC.zip

Duplicated here to allow easy integration with the GitHub Actions CI configured in some of my other repositories. A simple `git clone`is now sufficient to make SDL2 available on the CI Windows instance.

Includes a CMake configuration as an added bonus.
